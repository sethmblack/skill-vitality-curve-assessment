# Vitality Curve Assessment

Assess and categorize team members into performance tiers (top 20%, vital 70%, bottom 10%) with clear actions for each tier. Based on Jack Welch's differentiation principle: "Differentiation is the mother's milk of building a great organization."

---

## When to Use

- Annual or quarterly performance review cycles
- Building a new team and need to assess inherited talent
- Organizational restructuring requiring talent decisions
- Persistent underperformance in a team
- Questions about who to promote, develop, or manage out
- Request for "how do I evaluate my team?" or "who are my best people?"

---

## Critical Prerequisites

**WARNING:** The vitality curve is powerful but dangerous if implemented without these prerequisites:

1. **Candor culture exists** - People receive honest, regular feedback. If feedback is rare or sugarcoated, vitality curve rankings become political.

2. **Clear performance metrics** - Objective measures exist for success. Without them, rankings reflect politics, not performance.

3. **Manager commitment** - Leader must be willing to act on results, including managing out bottom performers.

4. **Team size sufficient** - In teams smaller than 15-20, forced percentages may not reflect reality. Adjust accordingly.

5. **Annual commitment** - This is not a one-time exercise. Welch did this every year, which prevented rankings from becoming stale.

## The Welch Framework

### The 20-70-10 Distribution

> "In my experience, roughly 20% of any organization are top performers. Roughly 70% are solid performers in the middle. And roughly 10% are not getting the job done."

**Top 20% (A Players):**
- Exceed expectations consistently
- Embody company values
- Energize and elevate others
- Take initiative beyond their role
- Are "irreplaceable" (though no one truly is)

**Vital 70% (B Players):**
- Meet expectations reliably
- Solid contributors to team success
- May excel in some areas, need development in others
- Form the backbone of the organization
- Many can become A players with development

**Bottom 10% (C Players):**
- Consistently underperform
- May have wrong skills, wrong role, or wrong attitude
- Often already known to colleagues as underperformers
- Improvement is possible but not without major intervention

### The Differentiation Principle

> "Differentiation is not about being mean. It is about building great teams. When you treat everyone the same, you are penalizing your best people and subsidizing your worst."

**Why differentiation matters:**
- A players are watching how you treat C players
- Failing to differentiate drives away top talent
- C players in wrong roles are also suffering (often they know)
- Fairness is not sameness

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: List Objective Performance Data

For each team member, document:

| Person | Key Deliverables | Goals Met (%) | Quality | Speed | Consistency |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [Name] | [What they delivered] | [%] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] |

**Rule:** Start with data. Intuition comes later.

### Step 2: Assess Behavioral Indicators

For each team member, evaluate:

| Person | Energy Level | Team Impact | Takes Initiative | Values Alignment | Growth Trajectory |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [Name] | [H/M/L] | [Lifts/Neutral/Drags] | [Yes/Sometimes/No] | [Strong/Mixed/Weak] | [Rising/Stable/Declining] |

**Key questions:**
- Do others want to work with them?
- Do they make the team better or worse?
- Would you rehire them if they quit tomorrow?

### Step 3: Force the Distribution

Now categorize. Be ruthless.

| Tier | Percentage | Your Team Members |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Top 20%** | [#] of [total] = [%] | [Names] |
| **Vital 70%** | [#] of [total] = [%] | [Names] |
| **Bottom 10%** | [#] of [total] = [%] | [Names] |

**The hard part:** You MUST identify a bottom group. Welch: "Every team has a bottom 10%. If you can't identify them, you're not being honest."

**Small team adjustment:** For teams under 15, use "top performers, solid performers, underperformers" without strict percentages, but still differentiate.

### Step 4: Define Actions for Each Tier

**Top 20% Actions:**

| Person | Reward Actions | Development Actions | Retention Risk |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| [Name] | [Bonus, promotion, visibility] | [Stretch assignments, mentoring] | [High/Med/Low] |

Welch: "Shower them with bonuses, stock options, praise, love, and opportunities."

**Vital 70% Actions:**

| Person | Recognition Actions | Development Priorities | Path to Top 20%? |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| [Name] | [Specific recognition] | [Skills to develop] | [Yes/Maybe/Unlikely] |

Welch: "They are the heart of the company. Develop them, motivate them, be honest about their potential."

**Bottom 10% Actions:**

| Person | Current Performance Gap | Improvement Plan | Timeline | Exit Plan if No Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| [Name] | [Specific issues] | [What must change] | [30/60/90 days] | [When and how] |

Welch: "You are not doing them a favor by keeping them in a job they cannot do. Be honest, give them a chance to improve, but be prepared to act."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Vitality Curve Assessment: [Team Name]

### Assessment Context

**Team size:** [#]
**Assessment period:** [Timeframe]
**Data sources:** [Performance metrics, observations, feedback]

### Distribution Summary

| Tier | Count | % of Team | Names |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Top 20% (A Players) | [#] | [%] | [Names] |
| Vital 70% (B Players) | [#] | [%] | [Names] |
| Bottom 10% (C Players) | [#] | [%] | [Names] |

### Top 20% (A Players) - Reward and Retain

**Who they are:** The irreplaceable contributors who exceed expectations and elevate others.

| Person | Key Strengths | Retention Actions | Development Focus |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Name] | [Strengths] | [Rewards, recognition] | [Stretch opportunity] |

**Priority:** Ensure these people know they are valued. If you lose them, you lose disproportionately.

### Vital 70% (B Players) - Develop and Motivate

**Who they are:** Solid performers who form the backbone of the organization.

| Person | Strengths | Development Areas | Path Forward |
|--------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| [Name] | [What they do well] | [Where to improve] | [Realistic trajectory] |

**Priority:** Be honest about potential. Some can become A players; others are maximizing their contribution in current role.

### Bottom 10% (C Players) - Improve or Exit

**Who they are:** Underperformers who need significant improvement or a different role.

| Person | Performance Gap | Root Cause | Action Plan |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| [Name] | [Specific issue] | [Skill/will/fit] | [Improve by X date or exit] |

**Priority:** Have the hard conversation. Welch: "Not telling someone they're in the bottom 10% is the cruelest thing you can do."

### Action Timeline

**This week:**
- [Action for A players]
- [Action for B players]
- [Action for C players]

**This month:**
- [Development investments]

## Failure Modes to Avoid

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Prevention |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| **Political rankings** | Top 20% are favorites, not performers | Require objective data before categorization |
| **Collaboration destruction** | People hoard information, undermine colleagues | Evaluate collaboration as key criterion |
| **Inflation** | Everyone rated top 20% | Force the distribution; someone must be bottom |
| **Deflation** | Manager claims no one is top 20% | If true, you have bigger problems; likely not true |
| **One-and-done** | Assessment happens once, never revisited | Commit to annual cycle minimum |
| **No action** | Rankings made but nothing changes | If you won't act on results, don't do the assessment |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use for teams without candor culture established
- Do not apply rigid percentages to teams under 15 people
- Acknowledge that even Welch's approach has been criticized and refined
- Include both performance AND behavior/values in assessment
- Recognize that "bottom 10%" does not mean "bad people" - often means wrong role

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient performance data | Flag gap; recommend data collection before assessment |
| Team too small for percentages | Use tier labels without strict percentages |
| Manager won't commit to bottom tier | Name the avoidance directly; assessment without action is theater |
| Everyone seems like "middle" | Force differentiation; every team has variance |
| Political concerns about names | Focus on criteria first, then apply to individuals |

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I have a team of 12 engineers. We're struggling to meet deadlines, morale is mixed, and I'm not sure who my best people are. How do I evaluate them?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Vitality Curve Assessment: Engineering Team (12 members)

### Assessment Context

**Team size:** 12
**Assessment period:** Last 6 months
**Data sources:** Sprint velocity, code quality, peer feedback, 1:1 observations

### Distribution Summary

| Tier | Count | % of Team | Names |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Top 20% (A Players) | 2-3 | ~20% | [Based on data] |
| Vital 70% (B Players) | 7-8 | ~65% | [Based on data] |
| Bottom 10% (C Players) | 1-2 | ~15% | [Based on data] |

*Note: With 12 people, exact percentages are guidelines, not mandates.*

### Top 20% (A Players) - Reward and Retain

**Identification criteria for engineers:**
- Consistently ships on time with quality
- Others seek them out for help
- Takes initiative beyond assigned work
- Raises the bar for the whole team
- You would fight to keep them

**Required actions:**
1. Have explicit conversation: "You are one of our top performers"
2. Ensure compensation reflects contribution
3. Give stretch assignments (technical lead, architecture decisions)
4. Ask: "What would make you leave?" - then prevent it

### Vital 70% (B Players) - Develop and Motivate

**Identification criteria for engineers:**
- Meets expectations but doesn't exceed
- Solid contributor but not a force multiplier
- May excel in some areas, struggle in others
- Reliable but not irreplaceable

**Required actions:**
1. Be honest: "You're doing solid work. Here's what would make you exceptional."
2. Identify specific development areas (architecture, testing, communication)
3. Pair with A players for learning
4. Set clear targets for advancement

### Bottom 10% (C Players) - Improve or Exit

**Identification criteria for engineers:**
- Misses deadlines repeatedly
- Quality issues require others to fix
- Colleagues avoid working with them
- Has been coached but hasn't improved
- You would not rehire them

**Required actions:**
1. Direct conversation: "Your performance is not meeting expectations. Here's specifically what must change."
2. Documented improvement plan with 60-90 day timeline
3. Weekly check-ins on progress
4. If no improvement: transition out. This is not optional.

### Addressing Your Specific Concerns

**Struggling to meet deadlines:** Your bottom tier is likely contributing disproportionately to this. One underperformer can slow an entire team through dependency, rework, and morale drag.

**Mixed morale:** Your A players are probably frustrated watching C players get treated the same as them. That's not fairness - that's unfairness to your best people.

**Not sure who best people are:** Ask yourself: "If I had to cut the team to 6 people, who would I keep?" Those are your A players. Now ask: "Who am I hoping will quit so I don't have to fire them?" Those are your C players.

### The Hard Truth

You know who your bottom performers are. Your team knows. The only question is whether you have the courage to act.

Welch: "Protecting underperformers is not kindness. It's a failure of leadership that punishes everyone - including the underperformers who are stuck in jobs they can't do."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Jack Welch** expert persona. Use it when performance evaluation or talent differentiation is needed. It pairs well with:
- **candor-culture-assessment** for ensuring foundation exists
- **four-es-leadership-evaluation** for leadership-specific assessment
- **a-player-hiring** for ensuring you're bringing in top talent

---

## Historical Note

The vitality curve, also called "rank and yank" or "stack ranking," was widely adopted after Welch's success at GE. However, many companies - including GE itself - have since modified or abandoned strict forced ranking. Research showed it could damage collaboration and create political behavior.

The underlying principle of differentiation remains valid: treating everyone the same is unfair to top performers and leaves underperformers stuck. The specific implementation (rigid 10% forced attrition annually) should be adapted to context.
